* Day 4: Spring Configuration – XML vs Annotations

* Annotation based configuration :
- @Component – Marks a class as a Spring-managed bean so that Spring’s IoC container can detect and create it automatically.

- @Autowired – Injects a dependency automatically by type (can be used on constructors, setters, or fields).

- @Configuration – Marks a class as a configuration class that defines one or more Spring beans.

- @Bean – Used inside a @Configuration class to explicitly define and return a Spring bean.

- @ComponentScan – Instructs Spring where to scan for components (@Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller).

*  Interview Q&A:
1. What is the difference between XML and Annotation-based configuration in Spring?
- XML config defines beans outside of code.
- Annotation config defines beans inside code using annotations.

2. Can you mix XML and Annotation config?
- Yes, you can have XML files with <context:component-scan> and annotation-driven beans.

3. What is @ComponentScan?
- It tells Spring where to look for @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller beans.
